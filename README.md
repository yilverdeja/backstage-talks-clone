# Backstage Talks Clone

<!-- TODO: Add a link to the 'clone' text when the clone site is public on netlify -->

A clone of the [backstage talks](https://backstagetalks.com/) website

## Why?

To practice my frontend skills using a bottom-up approach by first adding the basic styles, then designing sub-components, block-level components then finishing with the whole page.

In addition, I wanted to create this page is a layout to my pottery website.

## Interactions

On desktop, swipe up/down or use the keyboard up and down keys to move between issues. On the mobile version, users can just scroll without any of the trasform transitions.
